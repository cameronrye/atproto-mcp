## Architecture

The AT Protocol MCP Server bridges the gap between LLMs and the AT Protocol ecosystem:

    D --> G[Other AT Protocol Services]
```

## Use Cases

This MCP server enables LLMs to provide powerful AT Protocol capabilities through natural language interaction:

- **LLM-Powered Social Automation**: Enable AI assistants to manage posting, engagement, and content on behalf of users through conversational commands
- **AI-Driven Content Analysis**: Allow LLMs to analyze social media trends and user behavior through natural language queries and provide insights
- **Intelligent Community Management**: Empower LLMs to help users manage communities, moderate content, and engage with followers
- **Conversational Data Integration**: Let LLMs integrate AT Protocol data with other systems through natural language workflows
- **AI-Assisted Research & Analytics**: Enable LLMs to conduct social media research and analytics by querying and processing AT Protocol data
- **Smart Bot Development**: Build intelligent social media bots where LLMs handle natural language understanding and this server handles AT Protocol actions

**How it works**: Users interact with their LLM client (like Claude Desktop) in natural language, and the LLM uses this MCP server to access AT Protocol functionality. For example, a user might say "Search for trending posts about AI and summarize them," and the LLM would use the `search_posts` tool to fulfill that request.
